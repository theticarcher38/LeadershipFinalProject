                    The whole premise of this game is to learn about extrinsic and intrinsic
                    motivation
                    <br>
                    There are 5 levels to complete.
                    <br>
                    Each level has a scenario that outlines either intrinsic or extrinsic motivation
                    <br>
                    You must select the button of the type of motivation that the scenario is depicting.

                    <p class="scenario">
                        You are at your workplace, and your boss incentivizes all employees 
                        to work harder by offering a bonus to all employees who show an 
                        increase in productivity. This is an example of which type of motivation?

                        Unfortunately that is not the correct answer. This would be an extrinsic form of
                        motivation since the motivation is coming from an incentive offered by your boss.

                        You are studying for a test, and the only factor that is motivating you
                        to keep studying is a fear of failure. Is this a form of extrinsic or intrinsic
                        motivation?

                        While it is technically you motivating yourself to keep studying, this would still
                        be a form of extrinsic motivation as it is a fear of failure that is motivating you 
                        to study.

                        the fact that you enjoy the topic that the project is covering. What type 
                        of motivation is this?

                        This would be intrinsic motivation as the motivation for the project comes from an inner desire
                        to do the project.

                        This is extrinsic motivation since you are helping someone out in order to receive praise which
                        is an external reward.
